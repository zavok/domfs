# new tree concept suggestion:

I think this new design will be easier to implement and work with.

## root

Contains numbered directories representing different documents,
as well as special 'new' file:

````
/1
 2
 3
 new
````

On read from 'new' server will create new document and return it's
number.

## document

Contains numbered files representing different nodes of a document
tree, as well as special 'new', 'tree' and 'ctl' files.


````
/1/1
   2
   3
   4
   ...
   ctl
   new
   tree
````

Reading from 'new' creates new node, but alternatively you can just
write to files with numbered names directly.

## ctl

user can write commands there.

at minimum there should be 'adopt parent child' command

## tree

Contains tree structure.

example:

````
1
 2
 3
  4
 5
  6
  7
 8
9
10
11
12
````

Optionally we can include short description of the node after it's
number.

example:

````
1 element docroot
 2 element document
 3 element html
  4 element head
   5 element title
  6 element body
   7 element p
    8 text Hello World!!! Lorem ips...
````


## node

Contains node info.

General structure is:

````
type
data
````

What data is depends on type.  For text nodes it's text, for element
nodes it's attributes.

example:

````
element
a
id="logo"
href="www.example.org/logo.jpg"
````
